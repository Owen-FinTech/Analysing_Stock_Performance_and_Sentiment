# Project_1: Analysing Stock Performance and Sentiment

![Intro Image](Intro_Image.png "Analysing Stock Performance and Sentiment")

## Introduction

For this project we aimed to find out if social media sentiment, news sentiment and social media engagement have correlations with stock market price movements. Do human emotions that are  broadcast online, through text-based messages such as those on Twitter, influence the buying and selling patterns of others? Is the network effect of media amplifying market behaviours such as loss-aversion or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)? We also wondered if analysis of this data could be incorporated into a buying and selling strategy for stock market investment.

So, what is sentiment data? Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a Natural Language Processing technique (which is a field of Artificial Intelligence) used assign a score, or grading, indicating whether the sample text is positive, negative, or neutral. Although it isnâ€™t just a tally of good and bad words, it also attempts to understand the syntax and sentence construction around those words. It allows us to view the sentiment of huge samplings of text, more than what humans could sort through individually, and find patterns around different groupings, like hashtag mentions.

In our initial research we identified the [Finance and Social Sentiment for Twitter API](https://rapidapi.com/UtradeaAPI/api/finance-social-sentiment-for-twitter-and-stocktwits/) on [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/hub) that gives a real-time feed of sentiment scores for individual tweets that mention stock market tickers. It also has feeds that group this information with changes in the stock price for up to 200 tickers across specified timeframes. We also used [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to source news headlines by stock ticker and then had those headlines analysed by [Vader Lexicon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nltkdata/vader-lexicon) a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool for Python.

In order find out if there were correlations in the data, we broke the analysis into 5 main tasks:
-	Comparing Correlations in Bullish and Bearish Sentiment.
-	Comparing Correlations Across Different Timeframes.
-	Comparing Correlations Across Market Sectors.
-	Comparing Correlations Across Different Market Capitalisation. 
-	Comparing Different Kinds of Twitter Engagement.
